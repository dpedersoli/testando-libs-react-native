# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Verify compliance with testando-libs React Native Constitution v1.0.0:**

- [ ] **Modular Architecture**: Feature organized as self-contained module with clear public API?
- [ ] **State Management**: Using Zustand for feature state, local state for UI, documented pattern?
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Design works on both iOS and Android? Platform-specific code documented?
- [ ] **Clean Code**: TypeScript strict mode enforced? Functions < 50 lines? JSDoc present?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned? Touch targets 44x44+ points?
- [ ] **Documentation**: JSDoc with examples? README.md in feature module? API documentation?
- [ ] **Versioning**: Semantic versioning planned? CHANGELOG.md updates documented?
- [ ] **Tech Stack**: Using approved stack (React Native, Expo, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, Realm)?
- [ ] **Performance**: Goals align with constitution targets (< 3s launch, 60 FPS, < 200MB memory)?

*If any gate fails, document justification in Complexity Tracking section below.*

**Structure Decision**: React Native mobile application using feature-based modular
architecture as required by Constitution Principle I. Each feature is self-contained
under `src/features/[feature-name]/` with clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
