# Specification Quality Checklist: Form Validation System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification focuses on user needs (real-time feedback, secure passwords, customization) without prescribing technical implementation. All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Accessibility) are present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 17 functional requirements are specific and testable. Success criteria include concrete metrics (300ms response, 100% accuracy, 5-minute customization). Seven edge cases documented. Scope limited to email and password validation with custom styling.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three user stories (email validation, password validation, custom styling) are independently testable and prioritized. Each has 4 acceptance scenarios. Feature is ready for planning phase.

## Validation Results

âœ… **PASSED**: All quality gates met. Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

### Summary

- **Strengths**: Clear user stories with priorities, comprehensive accessibility requirements (8 specific AR items), measurable success criteria with concrete metrics, thorough edge case documentation
- **Completeness**: 100% - All mandatory sections filled with concrete details
- **Clarity**: High - Requirements are unambiguous and testable
- **Readiness**: Ready for planning phase

No specification updates required. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` when ready.
