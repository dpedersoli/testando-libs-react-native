# Implementation Plan: Form Validation System

**Branch**: `001-implementar-sistema-de` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-implementar-sistema-de/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a reusable form validation system for React Native that provides real-time feedback for email and password fields. The system uses Zod for schema validation, react-hook-form for form state management, and supports customizable styling via styled-components. Core requirements include email format validation (RFC 5322), password strength validation (6+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), real-time error messages in Portuguese, and full WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8+ with strict mode enabled  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native 0.79+, Expo SDK 53+, Zod 4.x, react-hook-form 7.x, styled-components, @emotion/native 11.x  
**Storage**: N/A (form validation is stateless, no persistence required)  
**Testing**: Jest 29.x with React Native Testing Library, manual accessibility testing with VoiceOver/TalkBack  
**Target Platform**: iOS 15+ and Android 10+ (cross-platform parity required)
**Project Type**: mobile - React Native with Expo managed workflow  
**Performance Goals**: <300ms validation feedback on blur, <500ms debounced on change, 60 FPS maintained during typing  
**Constraints**: No typing lag, <1KB bundle size impact per validation rule, works offline (no API calls)  
**Scale/Scope**: Reusable validation module for unlimited forms, email + password validators as foundation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Verify compliance with testando-libs React Native Constitution v1.0.0:**

- [x] **Modular Architecture**: Feature organized as self-contained module with clear public API?
  - ✅ Self-contained in `src/features/form-validation/` with documented exports
- [⚠️] **State Management**: Using Zustand for feature state, local state for UI, documented pattern?
  - ⚠️ Using react-hook-form (justified in Complexity Tracking - stateless ephemeral data)
- [x] **Cross-Platform**: Design works on both iOS and Android? Platform-specific code documented?
  - ✅ Pure React Native components, no platform-specific code needed
- [x] **Clean Code**: TypeScript strict mode enforced? Functions < 50 lines? JSDoc present?
  - ✅ TypeScript 5.8+ strict mode, JSDoc for all exports, function size limits enforced
- [x] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned? Touch targets 44x44+ points?
  - ✅ 8 accessibility requirements in spec (AR-001 to AR-008), VoiceOver/TalkBack testing required
- [x] **Documentation**: JSDoc with examples? README.md in feature module? API documentation?
  - ✅ README.md with usage examples, JSDoc for all hooks/components/utilities
- [x] **Versioning**: Semantic versioning planned? CHANGELOG.md updates documented?
  - ✅ v1.0.0 initial release, CHANGELOG.md will track API changes
- [⚠️] **Tech Stack**: Using approved stack (React Native, Expo, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, Realm)?
  - ✅ React Native, Expo, React Hook Form, Zod (approved)
  - ⚠️ styled-components instead of React Native Paper (justified in Complexity Tracking)
- [x] **Performance**: Goals align with constitution targets (< 3s launch, 60 FPS, < 200MB memory)?
  - ✅ < 300ms feedback, 60 FPS maintained, minimal bundle impact

**Gates Status**: 7/9 PASS, 2/9 JUSTIFIED VIOLATIONS → **APPROVED** (see Complexity Tracking)

**Structure Decision**: React Native mobile application using feature-based modular
architecture as required by Constitution Principle I. Each feature is self-contained
under `src/features/[feature-name]/` with clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Using @emotion/native instead of React Native Paper | User specified requirement for custom styling library, project already has @emotion/native 11.11.0 | React Native Paper styling insufficient for custom validation states and dynamic prop-based styling, @emotion/native provides CSS-in-JS with TypeScript support |
| No Zustand store (violates State Management principle) | Form validation is stateless, managed by react-hook-form | Zustand adds unnecessary complexity for ephemeral form state that doesn't need global persistence or cross-component sharing |

**Post-Design Update**: After Phase 1 design, using @emotion/native (already in dependencies) instead of adding styled-components. This reduces bundle size and leverages existing dependency.

---

## Phase 0: Research Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Artifacts Created**:
- [research.md](./research.md) - Technical decisions and best practices

**Key Decisions**:
1. Use Zod v4.x for schema validation (already in dependencies)
2. Use react-hook-form v7.x with zodResolver (already in dependencies)
3. Use @emotion/native for styling (already in dependencies - better than adding styled-components)
4. Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility with 8 specific requirements
5. Email validation: RFC 5322 simplified with Zod built-in validator
6. Password validation: Multi-rule with individual requirement tracking
7. Debounce onChange validation at 500ms
8. Portuguese error messages (extensible for future i18n)
9. Manual testing focus with optional unit tests

**No Unresolved Questions**: All technical decisions documented and justified.

### Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable implementation tasks organized by user story
2. Tasks will be created in `specs/001-implementar-sistema-de/tasks.md`
3. Implementation can begin following task dependency order

### Estimated Implementation Effort

Based on design complexity:

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: ~2 hours - Project structure, dependencies
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: ~4 hours - Zod schemas, type definitions, utils
- **User Story 1 (Email Validation)**: ~6 hours - Components, hooks, tests
- **User Story 2 (Password Validation)**: ~8 hours - Strength calculation, UI components
- **User Story 3 (Custom Styling)**: ~4 hours - StyleConfig, theming
- **Phase N (Polish)**: ~4 hours - Accessibility testing, documentation, cross-platform validation

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~28 hours (3.5 days for single developer)
