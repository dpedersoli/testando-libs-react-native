# Feature Specification: Form Validation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-implementar-sistema-de`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implementar sistema de validação de formulários em React Native com TypeScript usando Zod e react-hook-form. Deve incluir validações de email, senha (mínimo 6 caracteres, maiúsculas, minúsculas, números e símbolos), exibir mensagens de erro em tempo real e permitir estilização customizada via emotio-native."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Email Validation (Priority: P1)

Users need immediate feedback when entering email addresses in forms to ensure data quality and prevent submission errors. The system validates email format as users type and provides clear feedback about invalid formats.

**Why this priority**: Email validation is the foundation of form validation - it's the most common field type and prevents the majority of data entry errors. Without this, users waste time submitting invalid forms.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a form with an email input field, entering various email formats, and verifying real-time validation feedback appears correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on a form with an email field, **When** user types "test@example.com", **Then** no error message appears and field is marked as valid
2. **Given** user is on a form with an email field, **When** user types "invalid-email", **Then** error message "Please enter a valid email address" appears below the field
3. **Given** user has entered invalid email, **When** user corrects it to valid format, **Then** error message disappears immediately
4. **Given** user leaves email field empty, **When** field loses focus, **Then** error message "Email is required" appears

### User Story 2 - Secure Password Validation (Priority: P2)

Users creating accounts or changing passwords need clear guidance on password requirements to create secure credentials. The system validates password strength in real-time and shows specific requirements that are not met.

**Why this priority**: Password security is critical but depends on having a working form foundation first. This story delivers security value independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a password field, entering various password combinations, and verifying that each security requirement is individually validated and displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is creating a password, **When** user types "abc", **Then** system shows errors: "Minimum 6 characters required", "Must include uppercase letter", "Must include number", "Must include symbol"
2. **Given** user is creating a password, **When** user types "Abc123!", **Then** no error messages appear and field is marked as valid
3. **Given** user types password, **When** each requirement is met, **Then** corresponding error message disappears individually in real-time
4. **Given** user has valid password, **When** user removes a character making it invalid, **Then** relevant error message reappears immediately

### User Story 3 - Customizable Validation Styling (Priority: P3)

Developers need to customize the visual appearance of validation messages and form states to match their app's design system. The validation system provides flexible styling options while maintaining accessibility.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality works without custom styling. This enables design consistency across the app but is not required for basic operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying different style configurations to validation components and verifying they render correctly while maintaining WCAG compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer configures error message colors, **When** validation error occurs, **Then** error text displays in the specified custom color
2. **Given** developer configures custom border styles for invalid fields, **When** field has validation error, **Then** field border changes to custom style
3. **Given** developer configures success state colors, **When** field validation passes, **Then** field displays custom success styling
4. **Given** custom styles are applied, **When** screen reader is active, **Then** all validation messages remain accessible with proper ARIA attributes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user pastes text into email field (e.g., email with spaces)?
- How does system handle rapidly changing input (typing quickly, backspacing)?
- What happens when form is submitted while validation is still processing?
- How does system behave when user switches between fields rapidly?
- What happens if user has autocomplete enabled and browser fills multiple fields simultaneously?
- How does system handle special characters in email addresses (valid RFC-compliant addresses with +, dots)?
- What happens when password meets some requirements but not all?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate email addresses in real-time as user types (debounced to prevent excessive validation)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email format against standard email specification (RFC 5322 simplified)
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate password contains minimum 6 characters
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate password contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate password contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate password contains at least one numeric digit (0-9)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate password contains at least one special symbol (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
- **FR-008**: System MUST display validation error messages in user's language (default: Portuguese for this project)
- **FR-009**: System MUST show validation errors immediately after user interaction (on blur or after typing stops)
- **FR-010**: System MUST clear validation errors immediately when user corrects the input
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent form submission when any field has validation errors
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual indicators for field states: idle, valid, invalid, validating
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow developers to customize error message text
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow developers to customize validation message styling (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow developers to customize input field styling for different validation states
- **FR-016**: System MUST expose validation state (valid/invalid) for programmatic access
- **FR-017**: System MUST support validation on blur (when user leaves field) and on change (as user types)

### Key Entities

- **Form Field**: Represents an individual input in a form with validation rules, current value, validation state (idle/validating/valid/invalid), error messages, and styling configuration
- **Validation Rule**: Defines a specific validation constraint (email format, password strength, required field) with associated error message and validation function
- **Validation Result**: Outcome of validation check containing success/failure status, error messages (if any), and which specific rules failed

### Accessibility Requirements *(mandatory for UI features)*

- **AR-001**: All form inputs MUST have `accessibilityLabel` describing their purpose (e.g., "Email address input", "Password input")
- **AR-002**: Touch targets for all inputs MUST be at least 44x44 points (iOS) / 48x48 dp (Android)
- **AR-003**: Error message text MUST meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio against background (use WebAIM contrast checker)
- **AR-004**: Error messages MUST be announced by screen readers immediately when they appear
- **AR-005**: Form fields MUST have `accessibilityHint` describing validation requirements (e.g., "Password must have at least 6 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol")
- **AR-006**: Field validation state (valid/invalid) MUST be announced via `accessibilityState` prop
- **AR-007**: Error messages MUST be associated with their inputs using `accessibilityLiveRegion="polite"` for dynamic updates
- **AR-008**: Submit button MUST have `accessibilityState={{disabled: true}}` when form is invalid

**Testing**: Feature MUST be validated with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android) before completion.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users receive validation feedback within 300ms of completing input (on blur) or within 500ms of stopping typing (debounced on change)
- **SC-002**: Validation system correctly identifies 100% of invalid email formats in standard test suite (common invalid patterns)
- **SC-003**: Validation system correctly identifies 100% of passwords that don't meet security requirements
- **SC-004**: Developers can apply custom styling to validation components in under 5 minutes using documented style props
- **SC-005**: Screen reader users can understand field requirements and error messages without visual cues (validated through accessibility audit)
- **SC-006**: Form validation does not impact typing performance (no visible lag when typing quickly)
